# TODOs
# Description
A simple to-do list app written with React as part of Week 14 for MIT XPro's Professional Certificate in Coding course.

Add items to the to-do list using the form at the bottom of the list and press enter/return to add them to the list. Once an item is completed, click it to remove and ... voila! There's one less thing for you to accomplish today!
